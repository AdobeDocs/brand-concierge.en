# Adobe Brand Concierge

Brand Concierge is an AI-powered digital companion that transforms the way brands engage with their website visitors. Unlike generic chatbots, Brand Concierge delivers personalized, conversational experiences tailored to each visitor's intent. It helps visitors discover products, compare options, get instant answers, and receive guided recommendations in real time. The platform serves both B2C and B2B. It acts as an intelligent extension of your brand on any digital channel, while preserving your brand voice, content integrity, and compliance.

## How Brand Concierge works

Brand Concierge uses advanced AI and connects with Adobe tools to offer helpful, real-time conversations tailored to each visitor. It draws on approved brand content, product catalogs, and other trusted sources, ensuring that all information is brand-safe and up-to-date.

* **Conversational journey:** Visitors interact via natural text or voice, asking questions, receiving visual product comparisons, and exploring tailored recommendations.
* **Personalization:** The platform adapts its responses using customer signals, previous interactions, and behavioral data (with full respect for privacy and compliance).
* **Omnichannel integration:** Brand Concierge can be embedded across a brand's digital channels: websites, mobile apps, and even integrated SDKs for custom deployments.
* **Brand control and governance:** Marketers have easy, low-code tools to configure agent behavior, messaging, and workflow logic, keeping brand tone and safety front and center.
* **Analytics and optimization:** Built-in dashboards provide visibility into engagement, feedback, and conversion metrics, enabling continual experience refinement.

## Why it's beneficial for website owners

Brand Concierge stands apart from traditional chatbots and third-party assistants in several ways:

* **Brand-safe, trustworthy AI:** Unlike generic conversational AI, Brand Concierge only surfaces answers and recommendations based on your verified content. Marketers have full control over tone, messaging, and compliance guardrails.
* **Increased conversion and loyalty:** By meeting visitors with instant, relevant, and personalized responses (instead of static search or FAQ pages), Brand Concierge accelerates decision-making, boosts conversions, and keeps users engaged on your owned properties.
* **Upcoming feature - Seamless human handoff:** When a question requires a live touch, Brand Concierge can hand off the conversation (with context) to a sales or support agent, ensuring continuity and a smooth customer experience.
* **Continuous learning and improvement:** Each interaction enriches customer profiles and provides actionable insights. Marketers and site owners can see what customers are asking, gather feedback, and optimize flows without needing developers.
* **Flexible deployment, fast time to value:** Easily add Brand Concierge as a widget or embed it via SDK across your site or app. Deep Adobe integrations enable rapid setup for brands working with AEM, AEP, or Commerce, but it also works without them.

By adopting Brand Concierge, website owners unlock a new level of digital engagement: guiding visitors with high-quality, brand-aligned conversations that convert moments of interest into measurable business results.
